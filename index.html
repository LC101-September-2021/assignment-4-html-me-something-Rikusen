				<h2>Dance Dance Revolution</h2>
				<p id="text">Dance Dance Revolution, also known as DDR is one of the most iconic games that has ever existed. Originally started in Japan, 
				its a game that requires having to hit moving arrows with your feet by following the rhythm and timing it with the rhythm of the music. 
				This game is not only known internationally by many, but has featured many genres of music over its entire life span from all over the world! 
				Even to this day, the game is still very deeply loved and supported by its creators as it not only has online capabilities for score tracking
				and online music updates, but also they're constant release of new cabinets and releases of new versions of the game!</p>

               <h2>Beatmani IIDX</h2>
               <p id="text">Beatmani IIDX, which is also just shortened to IIDX, is another game that is internationally know. Infact, you'll find that pretty much
               every game on this list is well known outside of Japan! Though this is a rhythm game, the premise and learning curve of this game are ALOT
               more difficult. This is a 7 key game setup with a turntable on either it's left, or right side (depends on the side you play on). The game
               has a similar premise in which you have to hit the key or scratch the turntable that corrosponds to the button as it moves down the screen. 
               Not only is there more on the screen to keep up with, but the timing is also very strict compared to other games. This game also has support
               for online score tracking and updates to new versions. As is true for all other rhythm games in this day and age~</p>

               <h2>Sound Voltex</h2>
               <p id="text">Sound Voltex is a game built fairly similarly to IIDX, with exceptions to its button layout, and replacing the scratcher with two knobs
               on both the left and right side of the controller. Though this is primarily a 1 player game, it can be linked up with other machines within
               the same arcade center to play against others with the song being synced between up to 4 total setups! This game although seems easy within
               it's lower leveled songs, does have a very big increase in difficulty past certain levels as more is introduced during the play of the song.
               Overall, this game does feature something that no other rhythm game in this list has feature yet, and that's the ability to print out special
               collecible cards that you unlock via a system called the "Generator -Real Model-", which uses additional credits to print.</p>
